    <p>Soccer, known as football in most countries outside North America, is a popular team sport played by two teams of eleven players each on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective is to score goals by getting a ball into the opposing team's goal. Players are not allowed to use their hands or arms (except for the goalkeeper) and must use their feet, head, or torso to play the ball.</p>
